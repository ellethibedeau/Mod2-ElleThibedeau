    "The chart that we are referring to on page one shows the \"Survey Results\" with five categories ranging from 'bored' to 'excited'. While this would not be my first choice of visual representation there are some pros to this chart: five distinct categories, whole number data(can be visualized on a pie chart), and it gets the point across clearly. The cons are more previlant, if you continue reading the chapter this graph is used to show opinions before studying data science and after the program. A pie chart is not the best format to use when comparing these opinions. I do not think this would have been the best format or even in the top three choices. The color choices are not the best, but the could be worse. More distinct colors would have been better suited. For example, there are two shades of blue. The lengend is very short, which if these are the measured paramiters then it works fine. That being said I think the measured \"opinions/feelings\" should have been worded differently. The title 'Survey Results' doesnt provide us with information about the data and should be revised. \n",
    "If I were to redo this visual, I would use a bar graph to convey the change in opinions over time. The opinions would be along the X axis and the percentages would be reflected in the Y axis. Each opinion would have two bars to depict the before and after (taking the course) measurments. Two separate colors would indicate the before and after as well. "

    "By the way: why didn't I ask the question \"how can I check whether the customers all have unique AccountIDs\"?\n",
    "\n",
    "The problem would be that Google and ChatGPT don't know what \"customers\" you are talking about.  It's important to understand that the AccountIDs are a column of a DataFrame, and as such they are a Series.  Therefore, we should use the correct vocabulary and ask about a Series.  If you mess up and ask about a \"list\" instead of a Series, you _might_ get an answer that still works.  But it's better to get the vocabularly right.\n",
    "\n",
    "It's important to add \"in python\" because this task could be performed in many languages.\n",
    "\n",
    "ChatGPT gave me this suggestion: data[data.isin(data[data.duplicated()])].iloc[0]\n",
    "However, ChatGPT did not explain how this code worked and even claimed (falsely) that it was going to use the value_counts() function in the solution.  So although the code is correct, I personally found ChatGPT's answer very confusing.  You could, perhaps, ask ChatGPT to explain further how this code works.\n",
    "\n",
    "ChatGPT, \"How does this code work: data[data.isin(data[data.duplicated()])].iloc[0]\"\n",
    "\n",
    "On the other hand, Google leads me to the documentation for the duplicated() function:\n",
    "\n",
    "https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/reference/api/pandas.Series.duplicated.html\n",
    "\n",
    "Here, I can see that when I really need is data.duplicated(keep = False), where \"data\" should be the Series in question.  However, this just gives me a Series of boolean values indicating which ones are duplicates.  I have to somehow know that extracting the numerical values instead of a Series of booleans involves boolean indexing: data\\[data.duplicated(keep = False)].\n",

    "Choose any graph in the Introduction of Storytelling With Data.  Using matplotlib to reproduce it in a rough way.  I don't expect you to spend an enormous amount of time on this; I understand that you likely will not have time to re-create every feature of the graph.  However, if you're excited about learning to use matplotlib, this is a good way to do that.  You don't have to duplicate the exact values on the graph; just the same rough shape will be enough.  If you don't feel comfortable using matplotlib yet, do the best you can and write down what you tried or what Google searches you did to find the answers."
